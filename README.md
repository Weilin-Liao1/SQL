## Year-on-Year Sales and AOV (comparing sales and AOV over consecutive years)

This SQL report on year-on-year sales shows changes in sales volumes over the years, helping firms understand the factors impacting sales in specific years. Additionally, it allows the company to calculate the Average Order Value (AOV), an important KPI in the eCommerce industry.

How AOV is calculated:

AOV = Revenue / Number of Orders

A higher AOV indicates more revenue per order, suggesting that customers are spending more. In this case, the marketing and pricing strategies seem to be effective.
